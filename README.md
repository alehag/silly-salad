a bunch of paradox game mods
So far:
- a decision for CK3 and EU4
- the decision triggers an event to enable Newbie Protection, a number of bonuses designed to give players who aren't that knowledgeable in the respective games a slight edge
- not so much edge it's impossible to play around
- it's possible to cancel out of the event


Todo:
- add events to pop for all other players whenever someone takes Newbie Protection
- CK3 localisation
- sound sting to play when taking Newbie Protection in CK3
