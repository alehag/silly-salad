a bunch of paradox game mods

So far:
- a decision for CK3 and EU4
- the decision triggers an event to enable Newbie Protection, a number of bonuses designed to give players who aren't that knowledgeable in the respective games a slight edge
- not so much edge it's impossible to play around
- it's possible to cancel out of the event
- other players get notified when someone takes Newbie Protection (in EU4. In CK3 it isn't as important)
- CK3 localisation

Todo:
- Proof of concept for a disaster
	- would need at least 4 - 6 events
- Custom NI's for nations in EU4
